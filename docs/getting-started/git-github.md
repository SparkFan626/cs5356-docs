title: Working with Git & Github

One of the tools we'll be using a lot of over the course of the semester is Git & Github!

If you're already familiar with Git & Github, go ahead and skip to the last step at the bottom.

## If you're unfamiliar with Git...

Git is a version control system that is commonly used to keep track of code changes. Similar to how you can see previous revisions of an assignment on Canvas, or previous revisions of a Google Doc, you can see previous revisions of code, and document your new changes as you develop your project.

Get started by following the steps below:

- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and optionally, a GUI for Git like [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). You can use git through the terminal or through SourceTree - whichever you find easiest. No shame in the UI game.
- Create your [Github.com account](https://www.github.com) by going to Github.com and click Sign Up in the top right
- Then follow [their Introduction to Github text-based course](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github). The README will walk you through all the steps that you'll be using many times over the course of the class so its a good intro to the git workflow

I won't be going into a lot of detail on how to use git during class. That said, if you find that at some point you borked your git repository, and you're scared of losing changes, schedule office hours! That's what we're here for.
